     include: { projects: true }
   })
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```env
   # Update for production environment
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
   ```

3. **Authentication Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // Update OAuth app for production domain
   providers: [
     Github({
       clientId: process.env.GITHUB_ID,
       clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_SECRET,
     })
   ]
   ```
